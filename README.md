# Building Micro Frontends with Single-spa

This code goes along with the blog post [Single-SPA构建前端微服务（一）](https://laughingjacky.netlify.com/2020/03/28/single-spa%E6%9E%84%E5%BB%BA%E5%89%8D%E7%AB%AF%E5%BE%AE%E6%9C%8D%E5%8A%A1%EF%BC%88%E4%B8%80%EF%BC%89/)

## FEATURES

- support React Vue Svelte Riot Inferno
- HOT RELOAD except riot, @riotjs/hot-reload config is needed.
- Last three micro UI lib I really really prefer, enjoy a try.


## TODO

1. devide & seperate webpack config, build process, connect with SystemJS.
2. sub router control via sub system.
3. create portal app to handle communication.
